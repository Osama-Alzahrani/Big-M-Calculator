## Example
You don't have to make the equation in standerd from.
**<center>**

$\min  z = 2x_1 + x_2$<br>
$3x_1 + x_2 \geq 9$<br>
$x_1 + x_2 \geq 6$<br>
$x1,x2 \geq 0$

</center>

---

Result:<br>
    <img alt="Click to see the source" height="600" src="./Screenshots/Picture1.jpg" />
<br>
    <img alt="Click to see the source" height="600" src="./Screenshots/Picture3.png" />
<br>

```
 As you can see after applying the method The result is: 
 Z = 7.5
 x1 = 1.5
 x2 = 4.5
```
